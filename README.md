 ### Hi there <img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nixin72/nixin72/master/wave.gif" width = 10px/> I'm Michael!

Since leaving the public school system where I worked as a school bus driver, I have found myself drawn to coding. After working my way through a massive 40 hour bootcamp on Udemy I began working on building my own projects. 

However, I realized I still had much to learn so I joined a bootcamp called Grand Circus in Grand Rapids, MI and learned a great deal more. Since then I have continued learning and built various projects using my new favorite framework, ReactJs. 

I am always pushing myself to become more well rounded as is evident in my repositories. I follow the ABC's. Always Be Coding! Presently, I'm working on a web app called Stock Bites, a social media platform for those who love stocks and cryptocurrency. In addition to that I continue to work my way through various Udemy courses, picking up new skills to add to my arsenal.
